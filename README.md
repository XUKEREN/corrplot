## Summary
The R package **corrplot** is for visualizing correlation matrices and
confidence intervals. It also contains some algorithms to do matrix
reordering. For examples, see its
[vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html).

This package is licensed under GPL, and available on CRAN:
<http://cran.r-project.org/package=corrplot>.

## Basic example
```r
library(corrplot)
M <- cor(mtcars)
corrplot(M, order = "hclust", addrect = 2)
```

### How to contribute
- Fork, clone, edit, commit, push, create pull request
- Use RStudio
- Unit-testing: press `CTRL+SHIFT+T` in RStudio
  - we know that is hard to write tests especially for a visual package like this

### Reporting bugs and other issues
If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example on github.

### How to perform static code analysis and style checks
We use `lintr` which also performs the analysis on Travis-CI.
Configuration for `lintr` is in `.lintr` file.
Lints are treated as warnings, but we strive to be lint-free.

In RStudio, you can run `lintr` from the console as follows:
```r
> lintr::lint_package()
```
